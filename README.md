# Please DON'T blindly copy
It is the worst thing you could do for your learning. If you really do want to UNDERSTAND the concepts and how it links with computer science (and other fields, like math). E.g., to make pseudocode in Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics, you will need concepts from this. Blindly copying is the worst thing you could do, and I recommend only doing this if you have no clue, want to get a reference, or need some hints. 

# How to run? (Must do all steps)
1. Download it as a ZIP (or Git clone via cd:...). You can do this via the **GREEN** button at the top.
2. Unzip it and then, open the **.sln** file.

2.  If you can't see the files, go to **View** --> "Solution Explorer"

4.  Remove all the internal documentation (via AI tools)
5.  Add your own internal documentation

# Common error!
"Form1.resx being in the Internet or Restricted zone"

If you get this error, please follow these instructions:

1. Open the file explorer. and navigate to project directory.
2. Search for .resx file.
3. Right click the resx file, open the properties and check the option 'Unblock'.
4. Done! If you have any other resx files (it shouldn't for this project), then do the same.

# If nothing works

If nothing seems to work, and you really need it, then you can copy the ".vb" files in the name of the repo folder. Then make sure you copy the objects just the way it is with the EXACT same names.
